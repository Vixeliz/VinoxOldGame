# Vinox
Sandbox survival game made with Rust and bevy.
The goal of this project is somewhat like minetest but a much more limited scripting system at first with the upside of a more comprehensive base game and
more modern engine technology.

Reasons for the license choices:
For artwork the base game is heavily inspired off of a universe I have tons of lore built up for from years and honestly don't really want anyone else
to use commercially and I would like to be attributed if shared. As for source code I thought about it for a while lgpl made the most sense to me since I want
this itself to always be free and open source but am open to it being used in some capacity as a library in the future for other works.
