## HEAVILY IN DEVELOPMENT STILL NOTHING HERE IS FINAL AND THE CODE NEEDS REFACTORING

Sandbox survival game made with Rust and bevy.
The goal of this project is peaceful sandbox experience focused around exploration, discovery, automation, and building. With some lore that doesn't get in your way

Reasons for the license choices:
For artwork the base game is heavily inspired off of a universe I have tons of lore built up for from years and honestly don't really want anyone else
to use commercially and I would like to be attributed if shared. 


~As for source code I thought about it for a while lgpl made the most sense to me since I want
this itself to always be free and open source but am open to it being used in some capacity as a library in the future for other works.~

Now using MIT as i dont care about the source code just the art
